\section{Overview and motivation}

\IEEEPARstart{L}{andslide} runouts are regional-scale events that can bury whole towns (e.g., 2018 Southern California mudflows that followed a series of wildfires~\cite{lukashov2019post}) or devastate entire regions (e.g., 2016 Kaikoura, New Zealand earthquake recorded 100,000 landslides within a 12,000 sq. km area~\cite{dellow2017landslides}). The frequency of these regional-scale landslides is increasing with devastating earthquakes, extreme precipitation, and wildfires caused by climate change. Even in these risk-prone communities, where the residents are aware of the threat posed by the landslides and in some cases experienced significant modification to the landscape or their behavior, the residents repeatedly show indifference to the threats, consequently fail to act. The human capacity to deny danger endangers lives and property~\cite{kim2020public}. In 2020, twenty-two extreme events cost the United States \$95 billion in damages. The underlying problem is the uncertainty of the actual event and a lack of understanding of its potential impacts. How can the reality of potential risk be communicated to a diverse group of actors, who must understand and support a complex set of actions to reduce that risk for the whole community?
  
Visualization is the key to communicating scientific results effectively to engineering decision-makers and the public~\cite{mayer2005cognitive}. Given limited cognitive capacity, visualizing the complex information of threats as images enhances the brain's capacity to perceive opportunities and make decisions. Visual representation of complex information reduces the cognitive load on human information processing and increases human "absorptive capacity" for problem-solving~\cite{kahneman2012human}. However, these visualizations must be physically sound to be perceived as realistic and accepted as valid.

Despite the landslide risks, most regional-scale landslide hazard analyses do not consider downstream impacts and the aerial extent of debris-flow runouts~\cite{USGS2017debris}. Traditional numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) primarily focuses on the onset of failure but provides limited information on the post-failure runout mechanisms due to mesh distortions at large  deformations~\cite{soga2016trends}. Modeling the impacts of the potential runout of large landslides is possible with new tools such as Material Point Method (MPM)~\cite{Bardenhagen2000,Bardenhagen2004,Sulsky1994,Sulsky1995}. MPM is a mesh-free method that discretizes the domain as a collection of \textit{material points} moving on a background grid, and their deformations are determined by Newton's laws of motion. In this study, we employ the CB-Geo MPM code (\url{https://github.com/cb-geo/mpm}), and a typical MPM computation cycle is shown in~\cref{fig:mpm}. For more information on MPM and the code implementation, refer to~\cite{kumar2019scalable}. MPM results, which can then be used to translate the results of these analyses into effective visualizations to inform decision-makers of potential hazards. 

Visualization is also context and user-specific, i.e., different users may be interested in different aspects of the experimental or simulation data sets. Hence, the same data set may be represented in several forms â€“ perhaps at varying levels of detail, emphasizing or deemphasizing different regions and features, and employing different visualization techniques to best present the information. Data retrieval and visualization in High-Performance Computing applications have long been a bottleneck. Current techniques for visualization petascale simulation output involve writing a temporal slice of a subset of the data to disk. In practice, this usually means that the data are stored only at specific time-steps, often at a much coarser resolution than the original data, which leads to a significant portion of information being disregarded and potentially lost. A large-scale simulation running for thousands of time steps across compute nodes sampled at a predefined frequency of only every 100 - 500-time steps results in several terabytes of data. Nevertheless, the scale of such discrete geometry visualization will push commercial rendering engines like Mantra and Arnold to the limit. The amount of data would be several orders of magnitude higher at exascale levels, making the simulation spend most of the supercomputing time doing I/O.

In-situ visualization is a rendering technique for visualizing the simulation data in real-time without requiring additional storage resources. Running the visualization and simulation in tandem avoids the bottleneck of data transfer. Furthermore, this approach allows for monitoring and interaction while the simulation is running, which enables scientists to modify simulation parameters and explore the effect on the phenomena in real-time. In-situ visualization is a promising solution, and libraries such as ParaView Catalyst and SENSEI offer the ability to couple existing data models (such as VTK) to query regions of interest and to render simulations. Ray tracing engines such as TACC's Gravit and Galaxy offer distributed asynchronous in-situ visualization capabilities for petascale simulations.
